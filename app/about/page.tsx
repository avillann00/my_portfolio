          <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg">
            I am currently enrolled at the University of Central Florida where I am pursuing a Bachelors of Science in Computer Science and a Minor in 
            Mathematics.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg">
            I am mainly proficient in Python, Java, JavaScript, and SQL for my languages where I also use Django, React.js, Next.js, Express.js, PostgreSQL,
            and MongoDB for my frameworks.
            I am working on building my full stack development skills by building useful and complete applications to be an effective software engineer.
            
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg">
            Besides full stack engineering, I also am pursuing machine learning and artificial intelligence on the side by integrating various techniques 
            into the applications that I&apos;m building.
            I also am trying to incorporate other software engineering practices like deployment using Vercel and containerization using Docker.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg">
            In my free time, I enjoy watching sports and working out.
            I actually used to be on the varsity basketball team in highschool so I try to still stay active when I can.
            I am a big fan of most Florida sport teams which I enjoy watching with my family.
            I love to watch the Rays, Lightning, Magic, and Bucs and I hope that they continue to have success because I believe that on any given night we 
            can compete with the best. 
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg">
            I am a very big friends and family person who understands the meaning of commitment and hard work.
            I appreciate my parents a lot as they made me into the person who I am today.
            As often as I can I try to visit my friends and family so that I can spend time with them.
            My hometown is north Tampa, Florida so it is not too far away but I miss them very much.
